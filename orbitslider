                <h3>Subheadline</h3>
                <p>Since 1993 I've produced work ranging from dynamic web applications and interactive multimedia features, to marketing collateral. I can hand-code with the best of them but I thrive in a collaborative role as the bridge between developers and stakeholders. In that capacity, my big-picture understanding of both delivery mechanisms and business goals informs design decisions. Please read on to learn about what I can do for you.</p>
